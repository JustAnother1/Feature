Solution files define the logic of the application..

== File format
Solution files are xml files. The root element is a "solution" element.

=== solution element
==== Attributes
None.
==== child elements
The solution element has exactly one child element. The direct child element need to comply with the algorithm element style. The child must implement the "program_entry_point" API.

For the definition of algorithm element style see the documentation for the file format of the algorithm file.

== Example

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<solution>
  <os algorithm="super_loop">
    <blink algorithm="pwm_task" frequency="1Hz" dutyCycle="50%" >
      <greenLed />
    </blink>
  </os>
</solution>
